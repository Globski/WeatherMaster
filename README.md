# WeatherMaster

## Description

WeatherMaster aims to offer a smooth, ad-free experience while providing precise and timely weather information. The app aggregates data from multiple weather sources to ensure accurate forecasts.

## Features
- **Backend Server**: Developed with Flask to process requests, handle logic, and communicate with external APIs. Handles API requests and integrates with third-party weather APIs.
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js to handle user interactions, interface design, and display data. The user interface communicates with the backend server and presents weather data to users. 
- **APIs**: Routes for retrieving weather information, user preferences, and event management.
- **Cache**: Redis for faster data retrieval and improving response times.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes user requests to multiple server instances to enhance performance and availability.
- **Proxy**: Server-side proxy setup to handle API requests and overcome CORS issues.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Tools for tracking application health and performance.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment via tools like Circle CI.

## User Experience

- **Localized Alerts**: Timely notifications for weather changes.

## Environment

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- NPM or Yarn
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Weather APIs

- **Current Weather**
  - **Description**: Returns current weather conditions for a specified location.
  - **Response**: `{ "temperature": "15Â°C", "conditions": "Clear", "humidity": "80%" }`

- **Short-Term Forecast**
  - **Description**: Provides a short-term weather forecast (next 24 hours) for a specified location.
  - **Response**: `{ "hourly": [ ... ] }`

- **Long-Term Forecast**
  - **Description**: Provides a long-term weather forecast (up to 10 days) for a specified location.
  - **Response**: `{ "daily": [ ... ] }`

## 3rd Party APIs

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api): Primary source for weather data.
- [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/): Used as a fallback or supplementary source.
- [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/): Alternative source for cross-referencing data.
